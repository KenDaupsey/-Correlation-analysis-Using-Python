# -Correlation-analysis-Using-Python
This project demonstrates various correlation analysis techniques, including parametric and non-parametric methods, as well as Canonical Correlation Analysis, using the hsb2 dataset.

Correlation Analysis Project
This project aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of correlation analysis techniques using the hsb2 dataset. It covers both parametric and non-parametric methods for assessing relationships between variables, including Pearson's correlation, Spearman's rank correlation, Kendall's tau, Gamma, and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the hsb2 dataset, which is available at the following URL: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenDaupsey/-Correlation-analysis-Using-Python/main/hsb2%7Edata.csv"

Techniques Covered
Pearson's Correlation: A parametric measure of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.
Spearman's Rank Correlation: A non-parametric measure of the monotonic relationship between two ordinal or ranked variables.
Kendall's Tau: A non-parametric measure of the similarity in rankings between two ordinal variables.
Gamma: A non-parametric measure of the strength and direction of association between two ordinal variables.
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA): A technique used to identify and analyze relationships between two sets of variables by maximizing the correlation between their linear combinations.
